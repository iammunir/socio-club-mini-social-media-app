# Socio Hub - Mini Social Media App

This project is a demo project built on top of MEAN Stack.

## Angular Development server

Front End was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Backend Development

The backend server is built with a popular web framework for NodeJS, [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Please note I didn't include environment variables for connection to the database and the secret keyword to generate the JWT. Make sure you create your own.
